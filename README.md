The following are all the python projects in this repository along with the process that was used to analyze their respective datasets

## <ins>Screen Time Analysys</ins>

Screen time analysis lets you know how much time you spend on what kind of applications and websites using your device and the analysis gives a visual report of the same. For the task of screen time analysis, an ideal dataset (https://github.com/kodjoP/Python_Projects/blob/main/Screentime-App-Details.csv) that cotains data about:

1. Date
2. Usage of Applications
3. Number of Notifications from Applications
4. Number of times apps opened

### <ins>Analysis</ins>

1. import all necessary python libraries (i.e. pandas, numpy, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects)
2. read dataset into Jupyter Notebook
3. Look through the dataset for any null values and the descriptive statistics of the data (i.e. count, mean, std, min, ...)
4. Start analyzing the screen time of the user by looking at the amount of usage of the apps between Whatsapp and Instagram
5. Next, we'll look at the number of notifications from the apps and the number of times the apps opened.
6. Lastly, we look at the relationship between the number of notifications and the amount of usage because generally, we use our smartphones when we get notified by any app.
